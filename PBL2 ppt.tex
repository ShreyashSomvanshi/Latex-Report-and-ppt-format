  \frametitle{\bf ABSTRACT}
  \normalsize{\paragraph{Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide healthcare crisis. According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke.}}

\begin{frame}
  
  \normalsize{\paragraph{Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. The algorithms like K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support vector machine and Decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the diabetes.

    \normalsize{One of the important real-world medical problems is the detection of diabetes
at its early stage.In this study, various machine learning algorithms are applied on the dataset and the classification has been done
using various algorithms. In this study, systematic efforts are made in designing
a system which results in the prediction of diabetes. During this work,
four machine learning classification algorithms are studied and evaluated on
various measures. Experiments are performed on YBI Foundation Diabetes Database.
Experimental results determine the adequacy of the designed system with
an achieved accuracy of 80\% Using Decision Tree Algorithm. In future, the
designed system with the used machine learning classification algorithms
can be used to predict or diagnose other diseases. The work can be extended
and improved for the automation of diabetes analysis including some other
machine learning algorithms.}

%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item The failure of the Electricity Transformer is a crucial issue and has a major effect on the electricity system reliability. 
%     \item Failure causes a extra burden over the accounts and in turns it affect the level and quality  of the service provided.
%     \item If you predict remaining life of the transformer by some means causes relief on accounts-surprised!  
%     \item The transformer fails because of concentration of the vital gas components such as $CO_2$, $CO$, $CFC$, Temperature inside the transformer etc.
%   \end{enumerate}

% \begin{frame}
%   \frametitle{Innovativeness}
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item To understand the remaining life of the electricity transformer,there are some manual techniques.
%     \item By manual method the transformer is opened and checking the concentration of the $CO_{2}$, $CO$  and $CFC$ 
%     \item This causes physical damage to the transformer in turns it help to reduce the life of the transformer.
%     \item Without opening the transformer can we find out the concentration of the components like $CO_2$, $CO$, $CFC$ and temperature.- YES- by means of sensor network
%     
%   \end{enumerate}
%   \end{frame}
% \begin{frame}
%   \frametitle{Continued...}
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item The sensors like, $CO$, $CO_2$, $CFC$ and temperature sensors deployed on the the transformer reports, their readings to the host system. 
%     \item Based upon the previous learning and data received from sensor network host system calculates predicted remaining life of the transformer.
%   \end{enumerate}

%   
% \end{frame}
%
% \begin{frame}
%   \frametitle{Applicability}
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Per month thousands of electricity transformer get failed because of different reasons.
%   \item The most important reason is concentration of the different gases and temperature of the transformer. 
%   \item This decides the remaining life of the transformer.
%   \item Predicting the remaining life of the transformer can help to reduce extra burden at the failure time of the transformer
